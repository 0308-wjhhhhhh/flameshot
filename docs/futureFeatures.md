 This will gather some possible features to implement in Flameshot.
These are just conceptual and they may not be implemented implemented in a short period of time.

- Add Text Button: this could be very handy but requires a huge refactor of the source code.

- Mouse Visibility Button: if you look at the source code you'll find a lot of references about this. In fact it is almost implemente but it is disabled because the most important part (the code that fetches the mouse icon) is plataform specific and it requieres some of my time to end the implementation.

- Video Recording Support: I don't know if this will happen but it could be interesting to have a unified tool and satisfy every need to capture your desktop. Requires a ton of investigation.

- Wayland support
